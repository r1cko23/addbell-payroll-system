# Holiday Pay Calculation Scenarios

This document explains the calculations for different holiday work scenarios for all employee types.

---

## Scenario 1: Worked Day Before Holiday, Did NOT Work on Holiday Day

### Rank and File Employee

**Eligibility**: ✅ Eligible (worked day before)

**Calculation**:

- **Regular Hours on Holiday**: 0 hours (didn't work)
- **Holiday Pay**: `0 hours × Rate/Hour × 2.0 = ₱0`
- **Result**: **NO PAY** (because no hours were worked on the holiday)

**Note**: Even though eligible, if no hours were worked on the holiday, there's nothing to pay. The eligibility only matters if hours were worked.

---

### Supervisory/Managerial Employee

**Eligibility**: ✅ Eligible (worked day before)

**Calculation**:

- **Regular Hours on Holiday**: 0 hours (didn't work)
- **Holiday Pay**: `0 hours × Rate/Hour × 1.0 = ₱0`
- **Result**: **NO PAY** (because no hours were worked on the holiday)

**Note**: Even though eligible, if no hours were worked on the holiday, there's nothing to pay. The eligibility only matters if hours were worked.

## Scenario 2: Did NOT Work Day Before Holiday, Worked on Holiday Day Itself

### Rank and File Employee

**Eligibility**: ✅ Eligible (worked on holiday itself)

**Calculation**:

- **Regular Hours on Holiday**: 8 hours (worked on holiday)
- **Holiday Pay**: `8 hours × Rate/Hour × 2.0`
- **Example**: `8 hours × ₱125/hour × 2.0 = ₱2,000`
- **Result**: **FULL HOLIDAY PAY** (2.0x multiplier)

**OT on Holiday** (if worked OT):

- **OT Hours**: e.g., 2 hours
- **OT Pay**: `2 hours × Rate/Hour × 2.6`
- **Example**: `2 hours × ₱125/hour × 2.6 = ₱650`

**ND on Holiday** (if worked during night hours):

- **ND Hours**: e.g., 1.5 hours
- **ND Pay**: `1.5 hours × Rate/Hour × 0.1`
- **Example**: `1.5 hours × ₱125/hour × 0.1 = ₱18.75`

---

### Supervisory/Managerial Employee

**Eligibility**: ✅ Eligible (worked on holiday itself)

**Calculation**:

- **Regular Hours on Holiday**: 8 hours (worked on holiday)
- **Holiday Pay**: `8 hours × Rate/Hour × 1.0` (Daily rate, no multiplier)
- **Example**: `8 hours × ₱125/hour × 1.0 = ₱1,000`
- **Result**: **DAILY RATE PAY** (1.0x multiplier)

**OT Allowance on Holiday** (if worked OT):

- **OT Hours**: e.g., 5 hours
- **OT Allowance**: Fixed allowance based on hours
  - ≥ 8 hours OT: ₱700
  - ≥ 4 hours OT: ₱350
  - < 4 hours OT: ₱0
- **Example**: 5 hours OT = ₱350 (meets ≥4 hours threshold)

**ND on Holiday**: **NO ND** (they have OT allowance already)

## Scenario 3: Did NOT Work Day Before Holiday, Did NOT Work on Holiday Day Itself

### Rank and File Employee

**Eligibility**: ❌ NOT Eligible (didn't work day before AND didn't work on holiday)

**Calculation**:

- **Holiday Pay**: **₱0** (not eligible, no hours worked)
- **Result**: **NO PAY**

**OT on Holiday**: **NO PAY** (didn't work)

**ND on Holiday**: **NO PAY** (didn't work)

---

### Supervisory/Managerial Employee

**Eligibility**: ❌ NOT Eligible (didn't work day before AND didn't work on holiday)

- **ND Hours**: e.g., 1.5 hours
- **ND Pay**: `1.5 hours × Rate/Hour × 0.1`
- **Example**: `1.5 hours × ₱125/hour × 0.1 = ₱18.75`

## Summary Table

| Scenario | Day Before      | Holiday Day         | Rank and File Pay                                | Supervisory/Managerial Pay             |
| -------- | --------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| **1**    | ✅ Worked (≥8h) | ❌ Didn't work (0h) | ₱1,000 (Daily Rate - 1.0x × 8h × ₱125)           | ₱1,000 (Daily Rate - 1.0x × 8h × ₱125) |
| **2**    | ❌ Didn't work  | ✅ Worked (8h)      | ₱2,000 (Premium - 2.0x × 8h × ₱125)              | ₱1,000 (Daily Rate - 1.0x × 8h × ₱125) |
| **3**    | ❌ Didn't work  | ❌ Didn't work (0h) | ₱0 (not eligible, no hours)                      | ₱0 (not eligible, no hours)            |
| **4**    | ✅ Worked (≥8h) | ✅ Worked (8h)      | ₱2,000 (Daily Rate + Premium - 2.0x × 8h × ₱125) | ₱1,000 (Daily Rate - 1.0x × 8h × ₱125) |

**Key Points**:

1. **Eligibility Check**:

   - If worked on holiday → Always eligible
   - If didn't work on holiday → Must have worked day before (≥8 hours)

2. **Pay Calculation**:

   - **Rank and File**: Uses multipliers (2.0x for Legal Holiday, 1.3x for Special Holiday)
   - **Supervisory/Managerial**: Uses daily rate (1.0x) - no multiplier

3. **Holiday Pay Entitlement**:

   - **Rank and File**: If eligible (worked day before), entitled to Daily Rate (1.0x) even if didn't work on holiday
   - **Rank and File**: If worked on holiday, entitled to Premium Pay (2.0x total = Daily Rate + Premium)
   - **Supervisory/Managerial**: If eligible (worked day before), entitled to Daily Rate (1.0x) even if didn't work on holiday
   - **Supervisory/Managerial**: If worked on holiday, still get Daily Rate (1.0x) - no premium multiplier

4. **OT Allowances**:
   - **Rank and File**: Calculated OT pay (2.6x for Legal Holiday OT)
   - **Supervisory/Managerial**: Fixed allowances (₱350/₱700 based on OT hours)

## Special Holiday Examples

### Rank and File - Special Holiday

**Scenario 2**: Didn't work day before, worked 8 hours on Special Holiday

- **Holiday Pay**: `8 hours × ₱125/hour × 1.3 = ₱1,300`
- **OT Pay** (if 2 hours OT): `2 hours × ₱125/hour × 1.69 = ₱422.50`

### Supervisory/Managerial - Special Holiday

**Scenario 2**: Didn't work day before, worked 8 hours on Special Holiday

- **Holiday Pay**: `8 hours × ₱125/hour × 1.0 = ₱1,000`
- **OT Allowance** (if 5 hours OT): ₱350 (meets ≥4 hours threshold)

## Important Notes

1. **The "1 Day Before" rule is a policy check** - it determines eligibility, but actual pay depends on hours worked on the holiday.

2. **If you work on the holiday**, you're always eligible regardless of the day before.

3. **If you don't work on the holiday**, you must have worked the day before to be eligible. If eligible, you receive your daily rate (8 hours × rate × 1.0) even if you didn't work on the holiday.

4. **Current Implementation**:

   - If eligible and worked on holiday: Pay based on hours worked with appropriate multiplier
   - If eligible and didn't work on holiday: Pay daily rate (8 hours × rate × 1.0) for Rank and File and Supervisory/Managerial
   - If not eligible: No pay

5. **For Partial Days**: If you work partial hours (e.g., 4 hours), you get paid for those hours at the appropriate rate:
   - Rank and File: `4 hours × Rate × 2.0 = ₱1,000` (Legal Holiday)
   - Supervisory/Managerial: `4 hours × Rate × 1.0 = ₱500` (Legal Holiday)
