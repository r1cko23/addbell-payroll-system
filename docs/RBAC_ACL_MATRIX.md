## Special Access Rules

### HR Role Enhancements (Recent Changes)
- ✅ HR users now have approver permissions (`isApprover: true`)
- ✅ HR can approve OT requests (previously blocked)
- ✅ HR can approve failure-to-log requests (previously blocked)
- ✅ HR can approve leave requests at both manager and HR levels
- ✅ HR can view all employees (bypasses group restrictions)

### Salary Access Flag
- HR users require `can_access_salary = true` to access:
  - `/payslips` page
  - Employee salary information
- Admin always has salary access

### Group-Based Filtering
- **Approver/Viewer**: Filtered by `assignedGroupIds` (from `overtime_groups` table)
- **Admin/HR**: Bypass group restrictions, see all employees
- Group assignments managed via `/overtime-groups` (Admin only)

### Approval Workflows

#### Leave Requests (2-Step)
1. **Manager/Approver Level**: Approve `pending` → `approved_by_manager`
2. **HR Level**: Approve `approved_by_manager` → `approved_by_hr`
- Admin can approve at either level
- HR can approve at both levels (pending or approved_by_manager)
- Approver can only approve pending requests

#### OT Requests (1-Step)
- Admin/HR/Approver: Approve `pending` → `approved`
- Viewer: Read-only access

#### Failure-to-Log (1-Step)
- Admin/HR/Approver: Approve `pending` → `approved`
- Updates time clock entries automatically

---

## Access Denial Behaviors

### Redirects
- **Approver/Viewer** accessing `/dashboard` → Redirected to `/overtime-approval`
- **Non-admin** accessing `/overtime-groups` → Redirected to `/dashboard`
- **Non-admin/HR** accessing `/audit` → Redirected to `/dashboard`
- **Non-admin/HR** accessing `/bir-reports` → Redirected to `/dashboard`
- **HR without salary access** accessing `/payslips` → Redirected to `/dashboard`

### Hidden Pages
- `/employees` hidden from Approver/Viewer sidebar
- `/overtime-approval` and `/failure-to-log-approval` hidden from HR sidebar (but accessible if URL is known)

### Error Messages
- Access denied pages show: "You do not have permission to access this page"
- Toast notifications for access violations

---

## Notes

1. **HR Role Evolution**: HR role now has dual capabilities (HR + Approver), allowing them to approve requests while maintaining HR-specific access.

2. **Group Assignments**: Approver/Viewer roles are restricted to assigned overtime groups. Admin and HR bypass these restrictions.

3. **Salary Access**: HR users need explicit `can_access_salary = true` flag to access payslip generation and salary information.

4. **Payslip Approval**: Only Admin can approve payslips (change status). HR can generate and save but cannot approve.

5. **Audit Trail**: All critical operations (employee changes, loan modifications, etc.) are logged in audit tables (Admin access only).

6. **BIR Reports**: Admin and HR can generate BIR-compliant reports for tax filing purposes.
